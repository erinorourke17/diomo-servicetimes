## View the live version:

This site is very much a work in progress, and I am working on it regularly-- I hope for it to be a usable resource for people in the future.

The current version of the site can be viewed at http://diomo-servicetimes.uc.r.appspot.com/

## Purpose:

This site was inspired by MassTimes.org, which directs Roman Catholics to local church services when traveling. While serving in the Episcopal Service Corps, I decided that the Episcopal church needed a similar tool to help connect people with local services, and am in the process of developing a site that will serve this purpose.

## Technologies Used:

Much of the code for this project is written in Python, with some JavaScript, as well as HTML/CSS for the frontend. I use the Google Maps Directions and Geolocation APIs, and store data in a NoSQL Datastore database.

## Features I plan to add and bug fixes needed (in priority order):

I will remove items from this list as they are fixed and add others as I encounter bugs or think of features.

* Allow users to filter by day of week or type of service
* Offering autocomplete as a user types a location
* Add a page for users to add a church and update a service time

If you encounter other bugs while using the site, please reach out to Erin: erinorourke17@gmail.com
